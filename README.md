## Utitlities
The use of blockchain will help reduce frauds which are prevalent.There are some improvements which i have tried to make in this mockup over Kickstarter like the contributers can decide where to invest and can vote for the same and as the startup can only use the money if a minimum number of contributers approve for a certain request the contributers money is not used for luxuries.
